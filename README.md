# HHS Course: Software Architecture and Models
This repository contains my execution of the A&M course assignment. Unfortunately this course mostly contains Dutch documentation.

[Remember to add more information about the course in the future...]

This repository is incomplete! I didn't have enough motivation to create a properly documentened repo for this course. Most of the assignments are specifiek to a couple of classes and need to be implemented in a class diagram and Java code. The given codebase is a mess, with inconsistent naming and language usage.
